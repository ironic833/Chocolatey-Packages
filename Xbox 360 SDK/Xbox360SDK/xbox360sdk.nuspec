    <releaseNotes>This reference will guide you through the process of setting up your 
                  Xbox 360 development kit.  First, follow these steps to connect your 
                  console: 

                  1. Connect the AV pack that matches the input of your TV or monitor to 
                  the AV output on the back of the console.

                  2. Connect the video cable to the video input of your TV.

                  3. Connect the Xbox 360 controller to the console through the front 
                  USB port of the console.

                  4. Use a standard Ethernet cable (not provided) and connect one end to
                  the Ethernet port on the back of the console. Connect the other end to
                  your network. 

                  5.  Connect your PC to the USB emulation port:
                    
                    1. Connect the USB cable (provided) to the USB port on console labeled "DVD EMU".
                    2. Connect the other end of the USB cable to the development PC.

                  6.  Connect power to the console: The Xbox 360 development console ships with 
                  both 100v-110v and 220v power supply units (PSU).  If you use a 
                  converter with the PSU, you must use a CE-Marked 110v-220v 750VA 
                  step-down converter 

                    1. Connect the power supply to the console.
                    2. Connect the power cord to the power supply.
                    3. Connect the power cord to the power outlet.

                  Once fully connected, the console is ready for power.  Turn on your 
                  display, then press the power button to the left of the USB ports on 
                  the front panel of the console.  This will launch the console's boot 
                  sequence, during which time the TV will display an invalid video 
                  signal.  When the console has finished the boot sequence, a valid video 
                  signal will be sent to the TV and the Xbox 360 Launcher will be displayed.  

                  Note: If the console has completed its boot sequence, but a valid 
                  video signal still isn't being received, it may be necessary to reset the
                  video mode. You may use one of the following shortcut button
                  combinations on the controller to quickly set video mode:

                    o For NTSC-M, left trigger+right trigger+D-pad right*
                    o For NTSC-J, left trigger+right trigger+D-pad left
                    o For PAL-50, left trigger+right trigger+D-pad up**
                    o For VGA, left trigger+right trigger+D-pad down

                  * PAL-I 60 Hz (Europe)
                  ** Not supported in the current release

                  Note: The flicker filter is not enabled. As a result, images will
                  flicker on NTSC displays. The flicker will not show up when outputting
                  to HDTV or VGA. The flicker filter will be enabled in a future
                  release.

                  The first time the console boots, the Xbox 360 Launcher will request that
                  you enter a name for your console. Using the controller, enter a name
                  and then select OK to continue. The Xbox 360 Launcher will display a list
                  of the available applications on the console.

                  To turn off power to the console, simply press the power button.


                  Important information about the console hardware

                    * Make sure that you use only the power supply that comes with the
                      development console.

                    * Always plug the power supply into the development console before
                      plugging the power supply into the outlet.

                    * Console hardware is sensitive to static electricity; therefore it
                      is recommended that any static electricity be dissipated before
                      plugging in a controller. For example, walking across a carpet and
                      plugging in a controller without first touching a grounding
                      surface may reset the console.
