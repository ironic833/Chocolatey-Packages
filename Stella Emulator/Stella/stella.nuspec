    <summary>The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977, was the most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.  Now you can enjoy all of your favorite Atari 2600 games on your PC thanks to Stella!</summary>
    <description>Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Stella was originally developed for Linux by Bradford W. Mott, and is currently maintained by Stephen Anthony. Since its original release several people have joined the development team to port Stella to other operating systems such as AcornOS, AmigaOS, DOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, Linux, OS/2, MacOS, Unix, and Windows. The development team is working hard to perfect the emulator and we hope you enjoy our effort.</description>
